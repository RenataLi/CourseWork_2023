When analyzing and making forecasts for the stock prices of public companies using deep or machine learning models, an important element is the feature description of objects submitted to the input of models. The feature space consists of data such as financial statements data, relationship data, technical indicators, US companies data, and many others. With such a large number of features, at first glance it is difficult to determine which features have the greatest impact and how.  

In this project, we will try to explore the algorithmic side of constructing an optimal pipeline for working with a feature space: generating features, selecting them and analyzing their importance, taking into account the specifics of companies and the final target.

**Pipeline:**
1) Building ML/DL baselines to predict stock prices
2) Generation of a feature description based on data from different fields
3) Investigation of the issue of selection and the importance of signs
4) Identification of insights on the relationships between the set of optimal features for making predictions and the characteristics of companies

**Skills and tools:** `Python`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib` , `Seaborn`, `Time series`, `Data preprocessing` , `Data visualization`, `Scikit-learn`, `Darts`, `Shap`, `Lime`.
